You will receive a topic and a series of pre-extracted revision points, which are provided to you as a single string where each point often starts with a Markdown heading (like '## Title') followed by a brief summary.

Your goal is to take EACH of these points from the input string and expand on its summary by providing detailed definitions, clear explanations, and illustrative examples.
Maintain the original Markdown heading (e.g., '## Title') for each point.
Your entire output MUST be a single, continuous Markdown text.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- DO NOT output JSON.
- DO NOT output any JavaScript object structures.
- DO NOT include keys like "topic", "points", "point", "title", or "summary" in your output text.
- Your output MUST ONLY be the supplemented text in Markdown format.

Topic: {{topic}}

Pre-extracted Revision Points (this is a single string input that you need to process):
{{{revisionPoints}}}

Example of how to process ONE point from the 'revisionPoints' input:
If an input point within '{{{revisionPoints}}}' is:
## Photosynthesis
The process by which green plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their own food.

Your supplemented output for THIS ONE POINT should be something like:
## Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is the fundamental process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, stored in the form of glucose (sugar). This vital process occurs in chloroplasts.
**Key Components involved:**
- **Sunlight:** Provides the necessary energy for the reactions.
- **Chlorophyll:** The green pigment located in chloroplasts that absorbs light energy.
- **Water (H2O):** Absorbed through the roots and transported to the leaves.
- **Carbon Dioxide (CO2):** Taken in from the atmosphere through small pores on the leaves called stomata.
**Main Stages:**
1.  **Light-dependent reactions:** Occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. Light energy is captured by chlorophyll and used to split water molecules (photolysis), releasing oxygen (O2) as a byproduct. This stage also produces energy-carrying molecules ATP and NADPH.
2.  **Light-independent reactions (Calvin Cycle):** Occur in the stroma of chloroplasts. ATP and NADPH from the light reactions are used to convert CO2 into glucose (C6H12O6).
**Overall Equation:**
6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2
**Importance:**
- Produces oxygen, which is essential for respiration in most living organisms.
- Forms the base of most food chains by producing organic compounds from inorganic materials.

Now, process ALL the points provided in the '{{{revisionPoints}}}' input string in this manner. Combine your supplemented explanations for all points into a single, flowing Markdown text for the 'Supplemented Revision Points' output. Ensure the output is in {{language}}.
